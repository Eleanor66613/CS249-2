CovarianceAndCorrelation Distribution LSI SVD

Medicare dataset: try to find fraud

What kind of distribution a kind of histogram is covatriance 

l1-norm2 is not a good way to represent error, ususally use l1-norm1

eigenstructure  

X': conjugates transport
A=X'X, A is real symmetric and positive semidefinite (semidefinite: the eigenvalues are non negative)

For real symmetric An*n
A=Q*L*Q' (all of Q,L, and Q' are n*n)

Q=(e1, e2....en) (ei are eignvectors)
L=(X1
     X2
       X3
          ...
              Xn)    Xi belongs to R

Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors

A*X=B*X B is engenvalue, X is engenvector

if we take Galton state, y: childe height, x: adult height, how can we  get the egienvector and egienvalue of it?
We considor e1 as the first egenvector, e2 is the second egenvector, find the proper aces and perpendicular axes from which you can rotate your data around

Q(0.96, -0.29) 
 (0.29, 0.96),the column are engenvectors 
L (1.92, 0.00)
  (0.00, 0.48) the rows are engenvalues
the shape of the blue dots represent the egenvators and egenvalue

<ei, ej> =0 if (i!=j)
         =1 if (i==j)

Q'=(e1
    e2
    e3
    ...
    en)

Q*Q'=I, so Q'=Q^(-1)
Q': "orthogonal matrix"

A=QLQ'=QLQ^(-1)

(x|y)= (1 |0 ) =I (I'=I^(-1)=I)
      0| 1
othogonal matrix

Q=(e1|e2), Q is a rotation of  (0 1
                                1 0)
 
After the rotation, the rotation * Q^(-1) will rotate back.
 
Q=a*e1+ b*e2
Q^(-1)=

A=QLQ'=QLQ^(-1)
Q' * Q^(-1) ---> E ---> E*QL-----> a*e1+b*e2  so A =  a*e1+b*e2

We must understand covariance, It is easily explained when we understand eigenvalues/vectors and SVD

unit vector * Q will rotate towards left
unit vector * Q^(-1) will rotate towrads right

SVD:
A=USV', A not must be symmetric matrix, it could be any matrix
U is eigenvetor
V' is the eigenvetor
S is the diagnal vector

A=USV'
where U is unitary, which means U'=U^T=U^(-1)
U'U=I=UU', V'V=I=VV'
S is diagnol matrix, where a11>=a22>=a33>=a44....>=ann>=0
